# communityScanningTools
This repo is for the community to contribute any custom parsers for scan tools which Nucleus does not yet support. We know that keeping up with all the new scanning tools out there is a collaborative process, and want to support as many tools as possible. 
 

An example parser has been uploaded into the Whitesource folder to parse Whitesource xml output into a Nucleus csv format. Feel free to use this template as a future parsing script, or feel free to completely chop it up.

For examples of custom csv, xml, or json files that Nucleus supports, refer to the Nucleus docs at support.nucleussec.com.

You will get credit for your parsers that you upload. If you have created a custom parser for Nucleus, please submit a pull request! We will reach out to you with any questions we have/tests etc.
